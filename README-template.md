# The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process

  2. Header
  2. Countries list with [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com)
  3. Country details
  4. Dark mode
  5. Search by country
  6. Filter countries by region
